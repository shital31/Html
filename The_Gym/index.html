    <p style="width: 50%;">Gymnasia apparatus such as barbells, parallel bars, jumping board, running path, tennis-balls, cricket field, and
    fencing area are used as exercises. In safe weather, outdoor locations are the most conducive to health Gyms were
    popular in ancient Greece. Their curricula included Gymnastica militaria or self-defense, gymnastica medica, or physical
    therapy to help the sick and injured, and gymnastica athletica for physical fitness and sports, from boxing to
    dancing.
    
    Gymnasia also had teachers of wisdom and philosophy. Community gymnastic events were done as part of the celebrations
    during various village festivals. In ancient Greece there was a phrase of contempt, "He can neither swim nor write."
    After a while, however, Olympic athletes began training in buildings specifically designed for them. Community sports
    never became as popular among ancient Romans as it had among the ancient Greeks. Gyms were used more as a preparation
    for military service or spectator sports. During the Roman Empire, the gymnastic art was forgotten. In the Dark Ages
    there were sword fighting tournaments and of chivalry; and after gunpowder was invented sword fighting began to be
    replaced by the sport of fencing, as well as schools of dagger fighting and wrestling and boxing.

        <p style="width: 50%;">Then in the 18th century, Salzmann, German clergyman, opened a gym in Thuringia teaching bodily exercises, including
        running and swimming. Clias and Volker established gyms in London, and in 1825, Doctor Beck, a German immigrant,
        established the first gymnasium in the United States. It was found that gym pupils lose interest in doing the same
        exercises, partly because of age. Variety in exercises included skating, dancing, and swimming. Some gym activities can
        be done by 6 to 8-year-olds while age 16 has been considered mature enough for boxing and horseback riding.</p>
